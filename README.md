# social-media
 Social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and/or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. The Office of Communications and Marketing manages the main Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube accounts.
Social media is about conversations, community, connecting with the audience and building relationships. It is not just a broadcast channel or a sales and marketing tool.
1.Authenticity, honesty and open dialogue are key.

2.Social media not only allows you to hear what people say about you, but enables you to respond. Listen first, speak second.

3.Be compelling, useful, relevant and engaging. Donâ€™t be afraid to try new things, but think through your efforts before kicking them off.
